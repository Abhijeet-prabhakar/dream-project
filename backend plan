client:
user_input: = query
logic:
input = variable = input to the data.base
if variable contains "@" put it inside email.desk in the data.base
else if 
put it in the content section or content.desk in data.base.
python-side logic:
email.desk = query 
smtp send mail to query 
mail = message = content 
content = "anything" content would be in a variable so we can change it later easily rather then rewrite each string in the code 
if smtp sent mail == true:
print("mail sent was successful") on server side
else if:
print("mail not sent") on server side
